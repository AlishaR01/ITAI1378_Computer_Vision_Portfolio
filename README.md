# ITAI1378 Computer Vision Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my Computer Vision Portfolio for ITAI1378. This repository showcases my coursework, projects, and reflections from the class. It highlights my learning journey and the skills I developed throughout the course.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized by modules, with each folder containing the respective labs, assignments, and reflections:


## Key Highlights
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Learned about feature extraction and how CNNs process visual data.
- **Object Detection:** Explored bounding boxes and detection models like YOLO.
- **Transfer Learning:** Applied pre-trained models to new datasets to save time and resources.
- **Generative Models:** Gained insights into GANs and their applications for synthetic data creation.

## Tools and Skills Learned
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries and Frameworks: TensorFlow, OpenCV
- Concepts: Image preprocessing, neural networks, transfer learning, object detection

## Final Project
The final project involved enhancing an object detection model, focusing on improving accuracy through techniques like fine-tuning and data augmentation. [Link to Final Project Folder](./Final_Project)

## Reflections
Each module folder includes a `Reflection.md` file summarizing the key takeaways and skills gained from that module.

## How to Navigate
1. Browse the folders for each module to view the labs, assignments, and reflections.
2. Resources are located in the `Resources/` folder and include helpful articles, videos, and images used throughout the course.
3. Visit the `Final_Project/` folder for the final project deliverables.
