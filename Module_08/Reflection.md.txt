Module 08 Reflection

In Module 08, I focused on object detection, a vital application of computer vision. I learned about algorithms such as YOLO and Faster R-CNN, which identify and locate multiple objects within an image using bounding boxes.

A major takeaway was understanding how object detection combines classification with localization, making it an essential component of real-world computer vision systems.
