Module 09 Reflection

In Module 09, I focused on advanced optimization techniques for improving model performance. I learned about learning rate schedules, batch normalization, and regularization methods like dropout and early stopping to enhance training stability.

A key takeaway was recognizing how these techniques improve model accuracy and robustness, ensuring better generalization to unseen data.
